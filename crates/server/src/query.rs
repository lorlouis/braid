//! Terminal queries the emulator answered, cut from what a client sees.
//!
//! A query an application makes of its terminal — Device Attributes, a cursor
//! report — may be answered here by [`braid_vt`], and the reply goes to the
//! PTY. Those same query bytes are in the PTY's output, so forwarding the
//! output verbatim asks the *client's* terminal the question a second time and
//! its answer lands on the user's screen: a full-screen application's startup
//! `CSI c` left `?62;22c` on the prompt exactly so.
//!
//! What may not happen is the reverse. A query the emulator does *not* answer
//! has to reach the client, whose terminal will: that leak is the only reason
//! `OSC 11` background-colour detection and XTGETTCAP work at all here, since
//! libghostty-vt exposes no callback to answer either. Cutting one of those
//! turns a working capability into an application waiting for a reply that
//! will never come.
//!
//! So nothing in this module names a query. A sequence is cut on exactly one
//! signal — the emulator wrote a reply while consuming it — which is the same
//! fact the client's terminal would otherwise act on. A list of query shapes
//! kept here by hand would be a second answer to a question [`braid_vt`]
//! already answers, and the two would drift.
